<h2>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>CSS saves time : You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</h3>
<h3>Easy Maintainence : To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</h3>
<h3>Superior styles to HTML : CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
</h3>
<h3>Offline Browsing : CSS can store web applications locally with the help of offline catche.Using of this we can view offline websites.</h3>
<h3>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.</h3>
<h3>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</h3>
<h3>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</h3>
